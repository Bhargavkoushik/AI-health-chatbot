# 🤖 Medibot: AI Health Assistant 🩺

An **AI-Powered Health Assistant** that provides users with **health-related guidance**, **symptom analysis**, and **basic medical recommendations**.

It uses **rule-based logic** and a **RAG** (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipeline powered by a Groq LLM. When rule-based response fails, RAG fetches data from trusted medical databases to provide relevant answers for unhandled queries.

> ⚠️ **Disclaimer:** This chatbot is **not a replacement** for professional medical advice. Always consult a qualified healthcare provider for serious or persistent health issues.
