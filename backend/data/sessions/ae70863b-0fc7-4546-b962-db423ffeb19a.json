      "content": "I'm experiencing some breathing-related symptoms that have been bothering me for about a week. I have a persistent cough that brings up some clear mucus, and I feel like I can't take deep breaths - it's like there's tightness in my chest. I also feel wheezy, especially when I'm walking upstairs or doing light exercise. My throat feels raw from all the coughing, and I've noticed I feel more tired than usual. These symptoms seem to be getting slightly worse each day rather than better.",

      "content": "Oh dear, that sounds really uncomfortable. A persistent cough with clear mucus, chest tightness, wheezing that worsens with exertion, a sore throat, and increasing fatigue for a week… it's understandable you're concerned. These symptoms could be related to several things, and it's impossible for me to diagnose you remotely. \n\nHowever, given the combination of a cough, chest tightness, wheezing, and the fact that it's worsening, it's important to seek medical attention. These symptoms could indicate a respiratory infection, such as bronchitis or even possibly an exacerbation of asthma if you have a history of it. \n\nIt's crucial to schedule an appointment with your doctor or go to an urgent care clinic as soon as possible so they can properly assess your condition and determine the best course of treatment. They can perform a physical exam, listen to your lungs, and potentially order tests to get a clearer picture of what's going on. \n\nPlease don't hesitate to seek help – early diagnosis and treatment are key to managing respiratory issues effectively. I hope you feel better soon. Is there anything else I can help you with right now, or would you like me to help you find contact information for a local doctor or urgent care facility?\n\n**Sources:**\n1. medlineplus_structured.json\n\n*Response generated by gemini-1.5-flash-contextual in 5.98s | 2025-09-22T14:12:00*",
