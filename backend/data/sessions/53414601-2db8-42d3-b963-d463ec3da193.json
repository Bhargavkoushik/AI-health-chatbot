      "content": "Oh dear, a watery nose, fever, and body aches sound really unpleasant. I'm sorry you're feeling unwell. Since it's night and you can't see a doctor until tomorrow, let's focus on making you as comfortable as possible tonight.\n\nFor now, I recommend focusing on rest. Try to get some sleep. Drink plenty of fluids like water or clear broths to stay hydrated. Over-the-counter pain relievers like acetaminophen (Tylenol) or ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) might help with the fever and body aches, but *always follow the dosage instructions on the packaging*. If you have any concerns about taking these medications, please check with your doctor or pharmacist tomorrow.\n\nA cool compress on your forehead might also help bring down your fever. And try to avoid strenuous activity.\n\nRemember, this advice is for tonight only to help you manage your symptoms until you can see a doctor tomorrow. It's crucial to get a proper diagnosis and treatment plan from a medical professional. They can determine the cause of your symptoms and provide the best course of action. Please see your doctor as planned tomorrow morning. I hope you feel better soon!\n\n**Sources:**\n1. medlineplus_structured.json\n\n*Response generated by gemini-1.5-flash-contextual in 3.57s | 2025-09-22T14:05:53*",
