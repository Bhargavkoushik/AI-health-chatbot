I have a constant dull headache that's been going on for three days now, mainly on the right side of my head. My neck feels stiff and sore, especially when I try to turn it to the side. I also feel dizzy when I stand up quickly, and bright lights seem to make my headache worse. Sometimes I feel a bit nauseous too. These symptoms are making it hard for me to work on my computer and focus on daily tasks.",

      "content": "Oh dear, that sounds really unpleasant. A three-day headache on one side, neck stiffness, dizziness, nausea, and light sensitivity – that's quite a combination. It's understandable that it's affecting your ability to work and focus.\n\nI'm not a doctor, so I can't diagnose your condition, but based on what you've described, it sounds like you might be experiencing symptoms that could be related to a number of things, such as a tension headache, migraine, or even something else entirely. The combination of headache, neck pain, and dizziness is particularly concerning.\n\nIt's really important that you see a doctor or other healthcare professional as soon as possible to get a proper diagnosis and treatment plan. They can properly assess your symptoms and determine the underlying cause. Delaying treatment could potentially worsen your condition.\n\nIn the meantime, try to rest as much as possible in a dark, quiet room. Avoid bright lights and strong smells. Over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or acetaminophen might offer some temporary relief, but remember to follow the dosage instructions carefully. Staying well-hydrated is also important.\n\nPlease don't hesitate to reach out again if you have any other questions, but remember, I can't provide medical advice, and this information isn't a substitute for professional medical care. Getting a proper diagnosis is crucial.\n\n**Sources:**\n1. medlineplus_structured.json\n\n*Response generated by gemini-1.5-flash-contextual in 5.28s | 2025-09-22T14:12:50*",

Given that you've been experiencing headaches, nausea, and dizziness, it's important to focus on foods that are easy to digest and won't exacerbate your discomfort. I'm not a nutritionist, so I can't give specific dietary recommendations, but generally speaking, bland foods are often best when you're feeling unwell. Things like plain rice, toast, bananas, and applesauce are often well-tolerated. Staying well-hydrated is also crucial. \n\nHowever, because your symptoms – the headache, neck stiffness, dizziness, and nausea – are quite concerning and have lasted for three days, it's really important that you see a doctor. They can properly diagnose the cause of your symptoms and recommend the best course of action, which may include dietary advice tailored to your specific needs.

Regarding the headaches you mentioned earlier, and the other symptoms like neck stiffness, dizziness, and nausea, it's important to remember that I'm an AI and can't give medical advice. What I *can* do is offer some general suggestions that might help manage some of the discomfort while you seek advice from a doctor or other healthcare professional. \n\nSince you asked about fruits and vegetables, a healthy diet is always a good idea, and certain foods might help with some of the symptoms you're experiencing. For example, staying well-hydrated is crucial, so plenty of water is a must. Fruits and vegetables rich in antioxidants, like berries (blueberries, strawberries) and leafy greens (spinach, kale), might help reduce inflammation, which could potentially ease some of the pain. However, this is not a substitute for professional medical advice. It's crucial to get a proper diagnosis to determine the underlying cause of your symptoms.
