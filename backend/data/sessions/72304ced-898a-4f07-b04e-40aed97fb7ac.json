Broth-based soups are excellent – they provide fluids and electrolytes. Think chicken soup, or even vegetable broth. Also, foods that are soft and soothing on a sore throat, like mashed potatoes or applesauce, can be helpful. Remember to stay hydrated by drinking plenty of water, clear broths, or herbal teas (avoid caffeine). \n\nAgain, I'm not a doctor, so this isn't medical advice.

Since you mentioned it started just two hours ago, and now you're experiencing these additional symptoms, it's important to continue focusing on rest and hydration, as we discussed earlier. The broth-based soups I suggested are still a good idea, as they're easy on your throat and provide fluids to combat the fever. \n\nHowever, because you now have a fever, I strongly recommend monitoring your temperature and keeping an eye on how you feel. If your fever is high (above 101°F or 38. 3°C), or if your symptoms worsen significantly, or if you experience any difficulty breathing, please seek medical attention from a doctor or other healthcare professional.
