      "content": "I've been dealing with some uncomfortable symptoms around my head and neck area. I have a constant dull headache that's been going on for three days now, mainly on the right side of my head. My neck feels stiff and sore, especially when I try to turn it to the side. I also feel dizzy when I stand up quickly, and bright lights seem to make my headache worse. Sometimes I feel a bit nauseous too. These symptoms are making it hard for me to work on my computer and focus on daily tasks.",

      "content": "Oh dear, that sounds really unpleasant. A three-day headache on one side, neck stiffness, dizziness, nausea, and light sensitivity â€“ that's quite a combination of symptoms. It's understandable that it's affecting your ability to work and focus.\n\nI'm not a doctor, so I can't diagnose your condition, but based on what you've described, it sounds like you might be experiencing something like a tension headache, or possibly even a migraine. The one-sided pain, neck stiffness, and light sensitivity are all common migraine symptoms. However, dizziness and nausea could indicate other possibilities.\n\nIt's really important that you see a doctor or other healthcare professional as soon as possible to get a proper diagnosis and treatment plan. They can properly assess your symptoms and determine the underlying cause. Delaying treatment could potentially worsen your condition. \n\nIn the meantime, try to rest in a dark, quiet room. Over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or acetaminophen might offer some temporary relief, but remember to follow the dosage instructions carefully. Hydration is also key, so make sure you're drinking plenty of water.\n\nPlease don't hesitate to reach out again if you have any other questions, but remember, I can't provide medical advice, and this information isn't a substitute for professional medical care. Getting a proper diagnosis is crucial.\n\n**Sources:**\n1. medlineplus_structured.json\n\n*Response generated by gemini-1.5-flash-contextual in 4.22s | 2025-09-22T14:50:53*",
