      "content": "Oh dear, a watery nose, fever, and body aches sound really unpleasant. I'm sorry you're feeling unwell. Since I don't have access to your full medical history, I can't give you a diagnosis, but those symptoms could be consistent with several things. \n\nTo help you feel better, I recommend focusing on supportive care:\n\n* **Rest:** Get plenty of rest. Your body needs energy to fight off whatever is causing your symptoms.\n* **Hydration:** Drink lots of fluids like water, clear broths, or herbal teas to prevent dehydration, which is common with fever.\n* **Over-the-counter medications:** You might find relief from over-the-counter pain relievers like acetaminophen (Tylenol) or ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) to help with your fever and body aches. Always follow the dosage instructions on the label.\n* **Manage your nasal congestion:** Saline nasal spray can help relieve a stuffy nose.\n\n**Important:** These are general recommendations. If your symptoms worsen, or if you develop any new symptoms like difficulty breathing, severe headache, or a stiff neck, please seek medical attention immediately. I am an AI and cannot provide medical advice; this information is for general knowledge and supportive care only. A doctor can properly diagnose your condition and recommend the best course of treatment.\n---\nℹ️ **MEDICAL DISCLAIMER:** This information is provided for educational purposes only and should not replace professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
