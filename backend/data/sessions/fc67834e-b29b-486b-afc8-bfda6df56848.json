A watery nose can be caused by many things, from allergies to a common cold.\n\nTo help me understand better, could you tell me more about your symptoms? For example, do you have any other symptoms like sneezing, coughing, or a sore throat? Knowing more will help me give you more helpful information, but remember, I'm not a substitute for a doctor's visit. If your symptoms are severe or persist, it's always best to see a healthcare professional for proper diagnosis and treatment.\n---\nℹ️ **MEDICAL DISCLAIMER:** This information is provided for educational purposes only and should not replace professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
