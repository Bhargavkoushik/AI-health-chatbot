      "content": "Hello! A runny nose, or rhinorrhea as it's medically called, can have many causes. Since I don't have any information about your specific health history yet, I can't say for sure what's causing yours. However, some common causes include the common cold, allergies (like hay fever), and the flu. Sometimes, irritants in the air, like dust or smoke, can also trigger a runny nose.\n\nIt's important to remember that I'm an AI and can't give medical advice. If your runny nose is persistent, bothersome, or accompanied by other symptoms like fever, headache, or facial pain, you should see a doctor for a proper diagnosis and treatment plan. They can help determine the underlying cause and recommend the best course of action.\n\n**Sources:**\n1. medlineplus_structured.json\n\n*Response generated by gemini-1.5-flash-contextual in 3.99s | 2025-09-22T17:41:17*",
