      "content": "I've been feeling really unwell for the past two days. I woke up this morning with a pounding headache, my body feels achy all over, and I have chills even though I'm under blankets. My nose is stuffy and I keep sneezing, plus my throat feels scratchy when I swallow. I'm also feeling more tired than usual and don't have much appetite. What could be causing all these symptoms together?",

      "content": "Oh dear, that sounds really unpleasant. It's understandable you're feeling concerned with so many symptoms all at once. Based on what you've described – the headache, body aches, chills, stuffy nose, sneezing, scratchy throat, fatigue, and lack of appetite – it sounds like you might be experiencing flu-like symptoms. \n\nHowever, I'm just an AI and can't diagnose medical conditions. These symptoms could also be caused by other illnesses. It's really important that you see a doctor or other healthcare professional for a proper diagnosis and treatment plan. They can accurately assess your condition and recommend the best course of action. \n\nIn the meantime, focus on getting plenty of rest, drinking lots of fluids, and trying to eat something even if your appetite is low. Over-the-counter pain relievers like acetaminophen or ibuprofen might help with the headache and body aches, but always follow the dosage instructions carefully.\n\nPlease don't hesitate to seek medical attention if your symptoms worsen or if you develop any new concerns. Feeling better soon!\n\n**Sources:**\n1. medlineplus_structured.json\n\n*Response generated by gemini-1.5-flash-contextual in 2.45s | 2025-09-22T14:10:26*",
